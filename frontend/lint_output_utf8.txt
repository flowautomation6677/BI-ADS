  47:21  warning  Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image` or a custom image loader to automatically optimize images. This may incur additional usage or cost from your provider. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element  @next/next/no-img-element
